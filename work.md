# work

Created: November 2, 2022 3:34 PM

I face myself, go to work

break the rock

eat the fruit, 

the promise of my life

and if I eat the fruit,

who shall come for me?

and if I break the rock,

shall we be saved?

shining like a brazen image

I sink my teeth into forbiddeness

I do not inherit the shame

*****chack*****! and it is done
