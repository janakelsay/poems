# rock and stone

Created: December 30, 2022 1:15 PM

the pen in my hand is a rock

the one out of all the others around

that i choose to rest on

and listen to my babbling thoughts

flowing like a stream over it

the computer at my fingertips is a stone

it has been sculpted by someone else

and sits in front of me, testing me to put it to use
