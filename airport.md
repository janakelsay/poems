# airport

Created: March 27, 2023 11:00 AM

two of locked in the airport tonight

while the city of provo sleeps.

her monolithic boulders dusted white

limit the boundary of infinity.

two of us suspended in transport.

the rustling of our clothes

shifting on benches

signal signs of life.

two of us driftless, solitary

private and alone.

a machine must take us home.
