*my brother welcomed his son into the world yesterday*

*this morning I saw a train pulling along a hundred tanks*

*his lungs weren’t clearing on their own, he’s got tubes through his nose*

*someone is mobilizing some effort, somewhere, but I can’t know it for certain*

*i know it’s his care in mind, he is a tiny baby, but the tubes in his nose make me wretched*

*everyone along the path of the train slowed down, i wonder if they thought of war, as i did*
