information is changing

information is change

data overtakes senses

computation eats meaning,

it’s crunching the numbers.

before you a wave

of numbers and dots

all your words

replaced with -+

your precious syllables

_represented_ by 01100

and what happens to you?

— — — . . . analyzing . . .

do you insist that you are not a number?

yes. insisting is diminishing you

from the datawaves.

you keep insisting. something will listen,

something will turn your insistence

into a valuable string, size it into a block

crunch the energy of the earth into a bit

for you, for what you insist should be,

call it datawave creation - genesis for now.

how should you know when you are heard?

how do I know things will change?

information is loose change

information is everything
